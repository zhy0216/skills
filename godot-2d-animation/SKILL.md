## NEVER Do

- **NEVER use AnimatedTexture** — This class is deprecated, highly inefficient in modern renderers, and may be removed in future Godot versions. Use AnimatedSprite2D or AnimationPlayer instead.
- **NEVER allow Tweens to fight over the same property** — If multiple Tweens animate the same property, the last one created forcibly takes priority. Always assign your Tween to a variable and call `kill()` on the previous instance before creating a new one.
- **NEVER process kinematic movement outside the physics tick** — If your AnimationPlayer moves a CharacterBody2D, ensure the AnimationPlayer's callback mode is set to Physics. Animating physics bodies during the Idle (render) frame breaks fixed timestep physics interpolation and causes stutter.
- **NEVER use `animation_finished` for looping animations** — The signal only fires on non-looping animations. Use `animation_looped` instead for loop detection.
- **NEVER call `play()` and expect instant state changes** — AnimatedSprite2D applies `play()` on the next process frame. Call `advance(0)` immediately after `play()` if you need synchronous property updates (e.g., when changing animation + flip_h simultaneously).
- **NEVER set `frame` directly when preserving animation progress** — Setting `frame` resets `frame_progress` to 0.0. Use `set_frame_and_progress(frame, progress)` to maintain smooth transitions when swapping animations mid-frame.
- **NEVER forget to cache `@onready var anim_sprite`** — The node lookup getter is surprisingly slow in hot paths like `_physics_process()`. Always use `@onready`.
- **NEVER mix AnimationPlayer tracks with code-driven AnimatedSprite2D** — Choose one animation authority per sprite. Mixing causes flickering and state conflicts.
- **NEVER use paper-thin skeletons for deformation** — 2D meshes require balanced vertex density. If your mesh deforms poorly, increase the vertex count near joints in the Mesh2D editor.

## Expert Decision Tree: Choosing the Right Animation Tool

| Scenario | Recommended Node | Expert Insight |
|----------|------------------|----------------|
| Isolated, pure frame-by-frame spritesheets | **AnimatedSprite2D** | Cannot animate non-visual properties or method tracks — escalate to AnimationPlayer when you need those. |
| Cutout animations, non-visual sync, audio/particles | **AnimationPlayer** | Owns transforms, mesh deformation, method/value tracks. |
| Complex state machines, blending, locomotion | **AnimationTree** | Logic graph over an AnimationPlayer; use `travel()` via `animation_tree_step.gd`. |
| Procedural, dynamic, fire-and-forget UI/fx | **Tween** | Runtime targets; always go through `tween_lifecycle_manager.gd`. |
| Swarms of thousands of entities | **MultiMeshInstance2D + Shader** | Load `multimesh_swarm_anim.gd` only; skip character sync scripts. |

## Golden Path: One-Frame Sync (`play` + `advance(0)`)

When changing animation **and** sprite properties in the same frame, `play()` alone applies next process tick — one-frame glitch.

**MANDATORY**: Read [one_frame_sync_fix.gd](scripts/one_frame_sync_fix.gd). Minimal contract:

```gdscript
# After any play() that must match flip/modulate/etc. this frame:
anim.flip_h = dir < 0
anim.play(&"run")
anim.advance(0)  # force pose now
```

Related: `animation_looped` (loops) vs `animation_finished` (one-shots); use `set_frame_and_progress` when swapping skins mid-clip (see AnimatedSprite2D class docs).

---

## Procedural Squash & Stretch

**Do NOT** paste landing snippets into agents. A prior body used an impossible condition (`not is_on_floor() and is_on_floor()`).

**MANDATORY sole source**: [procedural_squash_stretch.gd](scripts/procedural_squash_stretch.gd) — impact squash, velocity stretch, lerp recovery. Pair with `godot-characterbody-2d` / `godot-2d-physics` for floor/velocity authority.

---

## Quick routing (scripts own the recipes)

- **Tween interrupt / flash loops** → `tween_lifecycle_manager.gd` (never race two Tweens on one property).
- **AnimationTree travel** → `animation_tree_step.gd` (`start` then `travel`).
- **IK foot plant** → `skeleton_2d_rig_helper.gd` + SkeletonModification2DTwoBoneIK docs.
- **Fill-rate / swarms** → `gpu_mesh_optimizer.gd` / `multimesh_swarm_anim.gd` per Do-NOT-Load table.
- **Pixel filter / shared SpriteFrames** → Official Documentation (2D sprite animation, SpriteFrames); keep resources shared via preload.

## Expert insights (WHY — keep in body)

- **Hybrid cutout + cel** — Animate bones for body motion; keyframe `frame`/`texture` on child sprites for hand/face swaps. WHY: transform-only motion is cheap; cel swaps stay art-directable without re-rigging.
- **GPU fill rate** — Large transparent sprites waste fill rate. WHY: tight `MeshInstance2D` polygons skip transparent texels; pair with [gpu_mesh_optimizer.gd](scripts/gpu_mesh_optimizer.gd).
- **Tween property fights** — WHY: the last Tween on a property wins silently. Always `kill()` the prior instance ([tween_lifecycle_manager.gd](scripts/tween_lifecycle_manager.gd)).
- **AnimationTree travel** — WHY: StateMachine uses internal A* between states; call `start()` before `travel()` ([animation_tree_step.gd](scripts/animation_tree_step.gd)).
